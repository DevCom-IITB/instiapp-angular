## Setup
### Use node version 14.16.1
All dependencies can be installed with `npm install`. To serve the application with hot module reloading, use `npm run start`. For an optimized production build, do `npm run build`.

## CI Built Files
GitHub actions will automatically build and push to the `built` branch.

## Contributing
All contribution guidelines mentioned in [the API repository](https://github.com/wncc/instiapp-api) are also valid for this repository. One other requirement is that linting should not fail during builds.
